# Stockholm-AirBnB-Analysis

# Introduction

Finding an accomodation is the most typical problem to be solved, when travelling to other city or country. And one of the most important things in choosing an accomodation is the reservation price. What are the main factors, which affect the reservation prices? Does time of the year influence prices and what are the busiest times of the year to visit particular city? How can we save money on the reservation?

# Data Source

I used the AirBnB Stockholm dataset porvided by AirBnB on their website (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/)

# Busiest time of year in Stockholm

The number of available listings for reseravtion tends to be the highest in the summer months. 

# Average price per month 

The average prices of listings per month is consistent throughout the year, except for a large spike in the month of March. This may be due to the listing in the price range of 601069 that was reviewed in the Month of March and it significantly impacts our diagram.

# Average price per neighbourhood

Prices differ depending on the neighbourhood in Stockholm. The neighbourhood with the highest average price seems to be the one in Farsta, which is surprising as it is on the outskirts of Stockholm. 

# Conclusion

Based on the data and analysis, we can see that the average prices of renting an AirBnB in Stockholm are on the more expensive side. The highest supply of AirBnB's is in the summer months, where Swedes probably go on holiday and want to rent out their apartments and rooms for extra income. Overall, AirBnB seems to be a profitable business in Stockholm.
